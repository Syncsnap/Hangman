# Hangman
A version of hangman made with Python!

Translated this version to Python3 and haven't been able to reproduce any errors, so it should be in working order now!

This is a console based version of hangman and my first run with classes, please let me know if anything can be improved, specifically in naming variables/functions and the commenting! 

Have fun playing :)!
